Reason why we don't have credit on main menu is that we're not required to do, quote from pixabay when downloading a image:
Crediting isn’t required, but linking back is greatly appreciated and allows image authors to gain exposure.
But it's always good to have somewhere to credit them

We have a few resource packs preinstalled and there should be a credit built in their desc, if not contat maggi373 on discord to notify him
